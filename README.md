The JaBroni Brewery

Project goal: create a version of Toy Tale with content displayed from the Punk API

You can find our API at https://punkapi.com

Specifications:

Posts will be summarized into a single card with an image. The following elements will be appended to the DOM using db info:

    name: 
    tagline: 
    image_url: 
    abv: 
    food_pairing:


Before entering the JaBroni Brewery we have coded a 21+ age verification alert with a friendly redirect if you're not of age. 

If the age is >= 21 you will be allowed to enter the page.

The user can sumbit a beer of their choosing by clicking the "Add a Brew!" button
"Have a beer you like? Add it here!"

"Enter a beer name..."

"Describe your beer..."

"Alcohol by volume (ABV)..."

"Enter a beer image URL..."

"Food pairing recommendation..."

We added a light and dark mode button for the user to toggle on the top left corner of the page.

We added a hover & shake feature to each card that is appended to the page.
